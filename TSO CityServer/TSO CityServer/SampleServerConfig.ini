Name: East Jerome
Description: "We're much more nicer than West Jerome" is the slogan of this humble city of industry, and the inhabitants couldn't be more right! Placid rivers and lakes, emerald pastures against dramatic cliffs make for some of the most picturesque scenery East of the Western Hemisphere. Frolic in the meadow while basking in the sunlight of East Jerome! (Not affiliated in any way with West Jerome.)
