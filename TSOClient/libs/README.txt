To compile this, you'll need to have Monogame 3.2 installed: http://www.monogame.net/downloads/
You also need BASS from: http://www.un4seen.com/
Then you need to reference MonogameContentProcessors.dll for TSOClientContent if it can't be
found. On Windows, this lib is located at Program Files\MSBUILD\MonoGame\(VERSION)\
