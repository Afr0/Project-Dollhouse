To compile this, you'll need to have Monogame installed: http://www.monogame.net/downloads/
Then you need to reference MonogameContentProcessors.dll for TSOClientContent if it can't be
found. On Windows, this lib is located at Program Files\MSBUILD\MonoGame\(VERSION)\
You may also need to copy libmojoshader_64.dll from the Tools folder.
