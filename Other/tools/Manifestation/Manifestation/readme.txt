Manifestation v. 1.0.0
======================

Manifestation is a tool used for generating manifests for updates.
With it you can add all the files that an update is comprised of,
add them into virtual folders (the folders they'll be in when downloaded
by the patch client) and open previous manifests and add parents and
childs to them.
For usage-instructions, run the program and go to the 'Help' menu.
