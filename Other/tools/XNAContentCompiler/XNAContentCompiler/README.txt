lf you do not have XNA 4.0 installed, you need to unrar "Microsoft XNA" into Program Files. 
You also need to unrar "XNA Game Studio" into Program Files (x86)\MSBuild\Microsoft\
Lastly you need to create an environment variable named "XNAGSv4" and point it to C:\Program Files\Microsoft XNA\XNA Game Studio\v4.0\
